# Introduction 
This repo is a collection of short, and longer scripts relating to the Microsoft 365 platform, the main purpose being gathering "nice to have" scripts in one place. Feel free to add your own and use existing ones, but please don't make major changes to any of the existing scripts without talking to the author first.

# Getting Started

All of these scripts are provided as-is in the sense that they may or may not be completed and 100% functional. Please use caution before running scripts you haven't written in a production environment.

# Contribute
Again, feel free to contribute your own code and scripts if they fit the bill. 
Just make sure to sign your work... ;)
